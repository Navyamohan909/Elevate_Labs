- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical features
- Normalize numerical features
- Visualize data using boxplots

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Dataset:
- [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)


# Task 2 - EDA on Titanic Dataset

## Objective
Perform EDA to understand the data, its distribution, relationships, and missing values.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas

- Missing data in "Cabin" and "Age" columns.

  # 🏡 Linear Regression on Housing Prices

This project is part of my AI & ML internship, focusing on predicting housing prices using **Linear Regression**. It aims to understand how property features such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms influence the price.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
To implement a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on given features using the **Housing Price Dataset**.

---

## 📁 Dataset
**Dataset used:** Housing.csv  
It includes attributes like:
- Area (sq ft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Price (target variable)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. **Imported Required Libraries**
2. **Loaded Dataset** using Pandas
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked for nulls  
   - Visualized relationships using scatter plots
4. **Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical data  
   - Handled missing values
5. **Feature Selection**  
   - Selected relevant features like `area`, `bedrooms`, and `bathrooms`
6. **Train-Test Split**
7. **Model Building** using `LinearRegression()`
8. **Model Evaluation**  
   - MAE, MSE, R² score
9. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted regression line for better understanding

---

## 📊 Sample Output

- **Mean Absolute Error:** _e.g._ 50,000  
- **R² Score:** _e.g._ 0.85  
- Visualizations included in the notebook

---

## 📎 How to Run

1. Open the notebook using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the `Housing.csv` dataset
3. Run the cells sequentially

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helped in understanding the basics of regression modeling and how to interpret housing data for price prediction. The trained model performs reasonably well and gives an idea of the impact of various features on the housing price.
